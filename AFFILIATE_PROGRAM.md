## FAQ

**Q: Is there a cost to join?**
A: No! It's completely free. No setup fees, no monthly costs.

**Q: Do I need to be a Reflexia user?**
A: Yes, we require affiliates to be active users. How can you authentically recommend something you don't use?

**Q: Can I promote to my employer/institution?**
A: Yes! Institutional deals are some of our best partnerships. We can create custom pricing for large groups.

**Q: What if someone signs up but cancels?**
A: You earn commission while they're subscribed. If they cancel, you don't earn for that month. But if they come back later (lifetime cookie), you start earning again!

**Q: Can I run paid ads?**
A: Yes, but not on Reflexia brand keywords. You can run ads targeting "CPD tools for nurses" but not "Reflexia discount" for example.

**Q: How long does my cookie last?**
A: Lifetime! If someone clicks your link today but subscribes in 6 months, you still get credit.

**Q: Can I see who signed up via my link?**
A: You see initials and stats, but not full names/emails (GDPR compliance).

**Q: What happens if I reach a new tier?**
A: Your commission rate increases for ALL referrals, past and future. If you have 4 referrals at 20%, then get your 5th, all 5 now earn you 25%.

**Q: Can I give my audience a discount?**
A: Yes! Tier 2+ affiliates get a 10% discount code. Your commission is calculated on the full price (we absorb the discount).

**Q: What if I want to create profession-specific content?**
A: Amazing! Tier 3+ affiliates can co-create Mastery Guides for specific professions and earn 60-70% revenue share on sales.
