❌ Promise rewards you can't deliver
❌ Let shipping costs exceed perceived value

---

## 💰 Monetization Math

### Example Revenue Model:

**Free Tier:**
- Core reflection features
- Basic CPD tracking
- Limited XP earning (500 XP/month max)

**Premium Tier (£10/month):**
- Unlimited XP earning (5,000+ XP/month possible)
- All Mastery Guides unlocked for 10,000 XP each
- Access to physical rewards
- Affiliate program eligibility

**Revenue Streams:**
1. **Subscriptions:** £10/month × 1,000 users = £10,000/month
2. **Shipping Fees:** £2-5 per physical reward (covers cost + small margin)
3. **Affiliate Program:** Drives new subscriptions
4. **Institutional Licenses:** £500-5,000 per organization

**Cost Structure:**
- Digital rewards: £0 marginal cost
- Physical rewards: £0.50-£3 cost, charged £2-5 shipping
- Affiliate commissions: 20-35% of subscription (acceptable CAC)
- Infrastructure: ~£100/month (hosting, tools)

**Profit Margin Example (1,000 users):**
- Revenue: £10,000/month
- Costs: £3,500 affiliates + £100 infrastructure = £3,600
- Physical rewards: Break-even or small profit
- Net: ~£6,400/month = £76,800/year
