### What They're ACTUALLY Looking For

**🎯 Insider Knowledge:**
When [REGULATORY BODY] reviews your portfolio, they prioritize:

## SECTION 3: THE REFLECTIVE PRACTITIONER FRAMEWORK

### The REAL Model (Reflexia Enhanced Approach to Learning)

**R - Recognize** the situation
- What happened?
- Who was involved?
- What was the context?

**E - Examine** your response
- What did you do?
- What were you thinking/feeling?
- What influenced your actions?

**A - Analyze** the outcome
- What worked well?
- What could be improved?
- What surprised you?

**L - Learn** and plan
- What will you do differently?
- What new knowledge/skills do you need?
- How will you implement this learning?

### Depth Levels (Use These to Deepen Reflection)

**Level 1: Surface** - What happened? (Basic description)
**Level 2: Understanding** - Why did it happen? (Analysis)
**Level 3: Insight** - What does this reveal? (Patterns)
**Level 4: Transformation** - How will I change? (Action)

**🎯 Pro Tip:** [REGULATORY BODY] wants to see Level 3-4 reflections. If you're stuck at Level 1-2, ask yourself "So what?" three times.

## SECTION 10: COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID

### Learn from Others' Mistakes

**PITFALL #1: Last-Minute Rush**
❌ **The Mistake:** Waiting until revalidation deadline to document
✅ **The Fix:** Monthly 30-minute portfolio review habit

**PITFALL #2: Quantity Over Quality**
❌ **The Mistake:** 100 shallow reflections with no depth
✅ **The Fix:** 12 deep, meaningful reflections showing real learning

**PITFALL #3: Irrelevant CPD**
❌ **The Mistake:** Attending any old course for the hours
✅ **The Fix:** Strategic CPD aligned with role and goals

**PITFALL #4: No Action Plans**
❌ **The Mistake:** Reflecting without implementing changes
✅ **The Fix:** Every reflection ends with concrete action

**PITFALL #5: Generic Reflections**
❌ **The Mistake:** "The patient was happy" (vague)
✅ **The Fix:** "Patient's pain score decreased from 8 to 3 after repositioning" (specific)

**PITFALL #6: Missing the "So What?"**
❌ **The Mistake:** Describing what happened without learning
✅ **The Fix:** Always answer "What did this teach me?"

**PITFALL #7: No Patient/Client Impact**
❌ **The Mistake:** Focus only on what YOU learned
✅ **The Fix:** Show how learning benefits those you serve

**PITFALL #8: Poor Evidence Management**
❌ **The Mistake:** Pile of random papers, lost certificates
✅ **The Fix:** Digital filing system from day one

**PITFALL #9: Working in Isolation**
❌ **The Mistake:** Never discussing learning with colleagues
✅ **The Fix:** Regular peer reflection sessions

**PITFALL #10: Copying Others' Work**
❌ **The Mistake:** Using generic templates without personalization
