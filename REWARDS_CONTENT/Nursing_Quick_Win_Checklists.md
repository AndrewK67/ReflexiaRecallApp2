- Hydrate patient if possible

---

### Size Guide

**Choose wisely:**
- **22G (blue):** Elderly, fragile veins, paeds
- **20G (pink):** Standard fluids, medications
- **18G (green):** Blood transfusion, rapid fluids
- **16G (gray):** Resus, major hemorrhage

**Rule:** Smallest size that meets clinical need

---

### Insertion Technique

**Step-by-Step:**
1. [ ] Apply tourniquet (not too tight!)
2. [ ] Identify vein
3. [ ] Clean with alcohol wipe (30 secs, allow to dry)
4. [ ] Anchor vein (pull skin taut)
5. [ ] Insert at 10-30° angle
6. [ ] Watch for flashback
7. [ ] Advance cannula slightly
8. [ ] Lower angle, advance cannula off needle
9. [ ] Release tourniquet
10. [ ] Press above cannula tip
11. [ ] Remove needle into sharps bin
12. [ ] Attach flush/extension
13. [ ] Flush to check patency
14. [ ] Secure with dressing
15. [ ] Document (date, time, site, size, your signature)

---

### Troubleshooting

**No flashback?**
- Too shallow - redirect slightly
- Through the vein - pull back slowly
- Wrong vein - try another

**Flashback but can't advance?**
- Valve blocking - try gentle flush
- Pulling on skin - release slightly
- Through vein - remove and try again

**Won't flush?**
- Tissue - remove, failed attempt
- Against valve - try gentle flush
- Blocked - remove, failed attempt

---

### Post-Procedure

- [ ] Check cannula flushing
- [ ] Check no swelling/extravasation
- [ ] Secure properly
- [ ] Date label on dressing
- [ ] Document in notes
- [ ] Dispose of sharps safely

---

### Documentation

**Record:**

---

### 🚨 When to STOP

**Stop attempting if:**

**Escalate to:**

---

### 💡 Pro Tips for Success

**Increase Success Rate:**
✅ Practice on easier patients first
✅ Good lighting essential
✅ Patient relaxed = better veins

✅ Know when to stop and ask for help

**Common Mistakes:**

❌ Too steep angle
❌ Moving cannula once in
